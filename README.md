### Introduction

In this document I will be explaining some of the important decisions I have taken during the execution of this work as well as provide some good documentation about my completed solution.

## Features

I have been able to do a clone of the aribnb home page as requested with the required features such as ;

- listings in grid view
- Navigation bar with the required elements
- Categories filter etc.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

### Future Improvements ( if I had more time )

- Fix very minor responsiveness issues generally.
- Currently I have written a handful of unit tests using Jest and React Testing library and integration tests using cypress with more time I would love to add more test cases to cover for relevant edge cases.
